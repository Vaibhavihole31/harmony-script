# Types

Understand the different types in JavaScript, including primitives and complex types.

## Primitives

Primitives are basic types in JavaScript. When you work with a primitive type, you directly manipulate its value. The following are the primitive types in JavaScript:

* `string` : Represents textual data.
* `number`: Represents numeric values.
* `boolean`: Represents true or false values.
* `null`: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
* `undefined`: Represents an uninitialized or undefined value.
* `symbol`: Represents unique and immutable values that can be used as object keys.
* `bigint`: Represents arbitrary-precision integers larger than the range of the number type.

**Here are examples of each primitive type in JavaScript:**

```js
const str = 'Hello';        // string
const num = 42;             // number
const bool = true;          // boolean
const n = null;             // null
let und;                    // undefined
const sym = Symbol('foo');  // symbol
const bigInt = BigInt(123); // bigint

console.log(typeof str);    // Output: string
console.log(typeof num);    // Output: number
console.log(typeof bool);   // Output: boolean
console.log(typeof n);      // Output: object (typeof null is an implementation quirk)
console.log(typeof und);    // Output: undefined
console.log(typeof sym);    // Output: symbol
console.log(typeof bigInt); // Output: bigint
```

In this example, we define variables of each primitive type and use the `typeof` operator to determine their respective types. The `console.log` statements show the outputs when printing the types.

## Complex Types

Complex types refer to values that are composed of multiple components. When you work with complex types, you manipulate a reference to their value. The following are the complex types in JavaScript:

* `object`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
* `array`: Represents an ordered list of values.
* `function`: Represents reusable blocks of code.

**Here are examples of each complex type in JavaScript:**

```js
const obj = {                // object
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
};

const arr = [1, 2, 3];       // array

const func = function() {    // function
  console.log('Hello!');
};

console.log(typeof obj);     // Output: object
console.log(typeof arr);     // Output: object (arrays are a specialized type of object)
console.log(typeof func);    // Output: function
```

In this example, we define variables of each complex type. `obj` represents an object with properties for `name`, `age`, and `city`. `arr` represents an array with three elements. `func` represents a function that logs `Hello!` to the console.

The `typeof` operator is used to determine the types of `obj`, `arr`, and `func`. The `console.log` statements show the outputs when printing the types.ch

# Effective Variable Usage in JavaScript

## 1. Use `const` for all of your references

* When declaring variables that won't be reassigned, use const.

* Using `const` ensures that you can't accidentally reassign the reference, leading to more predictable and bug-free code.

* Examples:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
```

## 2. **Use `let` if you need to reassign references**

* If you need to reassign a reference, use `let` instead of `var`.

* `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block where it's defined, unlike `var` which is function-scoped.

* Examples:

```js
let count = 1;
if (true) {
  count += 1;
}
```

## 3. **Block scope with `const`, `let`, and `var`**

* Both `const` and `let` are block-scoped, which means they only exist within the block they are defined in.

* `var`, on the other hand, is function-scoped.

* Examples:

```js
{
  let a = 1;
  const b = 1;
  var c = 1;
}
console.log(a); // ReferenceError
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
console.log(c); // Prints 1
```

In the above code, `a` and `b` will produce a `ReferenceError` because they are block-scoped, while `c` can be accessed because it is function-scoped.
